# AnantaWare  
### Warehouse Service & Inventory Management System (MEAN Stack)

---

## 📌 Overview

**AnantaWare** is a service-based warehouse management system where customers store their own inventory and are charged for warehouse services such as storage and handling.

> ❗ This is NOT an e-commerce system — no buying/selling of products.

The system provides centralized management of inventory, services, and users with role-based access.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

- Customers own the inventory  
- Warehouse provides services  
- Billing is based on:  
  - Storage duration  
  - Handling operations  
  - Service usage  

---

## 👥 User Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|-------|
| Admin | Full system control, user management |
| Warehouse Manager | Inventory & operations handling |
| Customer | View inventory, services, profile |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: Angular 19 (Standalone Components)  
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js  
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas)  
- Authentication: JWT  
- Version Control: Git
